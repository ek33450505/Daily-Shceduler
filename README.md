# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description 
The purpose of this project was to create a daily planner for to help me with my busy work schedule. I need the ability to add important events to a daily planner in order to manage my time effectively. When the planner is opened the current time and date is set at the top. As I scroll down the page I am presented with time blocks and for each hour during my time at work (9am-5pm). Time blocks are color coded to show past, future and current time windows. When I click on a block I am able to insert, edit and save the text to local storage so that it is still available to me after I refresh the page.
